![The Grieger Triptychial map projection rendered in Geocart](geocart-grieger-triptychial.png)

Geocart `.geo3` project files are created in-app, and are projects that display the Grieger Triptychial projection. They are made following [this guide](https://blog.map-projections.net/lee-markley-calm-and-grieger#grieger) by Tobias Jung

Imported databases are various recolours of the standard [equirectangular projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection), made by Nick Yonge, for simpler visual display within Geocart
